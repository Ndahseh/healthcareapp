        <p class="services_text">Personal Care is not just about offering physical support
            and assistance, our staff are trained to offer advice and encouragement to our service
            users as well as building a trusting relationship to ensure the service user knows they
            have emotional and physcological support. We ensure that all of our support workers are
            rigorously trained in many aspects of Health and Safety procedures including moving and
            handling as well as food hygiene and first aid.</p>
        <p class="new_text">
            We only choose the very best when it comes to recruiting our team of care workers. We then
            assess any areas that our people may need additional training in before we assign them to
            our service users. We understand that our service users deserve discretion and respect when
            it comes to our service users dignity and privacy which is why we put this to the forefront
            of our recruitment process. We are not only there to assist in the daily lives of our service
            users but we also strive to help our service users to have independence and control to the best
            of their ability.</p>
